                <p id="textCard1">Brazil, formally known as the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest nation in South America and the easternmost in both South and Latin America. It ranks as the fifth-largest country globally by land area and the seventh most populous. Brasília serves as its capital, while São Paulo is its largest city by population. The country consists of 26 states and one Federal District, operating as a federation. Uniquely in the Americas, Portuguese is its official language. Brazil is recognized as one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural countries, a result of over a century of significant immigration from various parts of the globe.</p>
